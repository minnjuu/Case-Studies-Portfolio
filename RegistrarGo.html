        <h2>Project Type</h2>
        <p>
            This conceptual project includes the involvement of the students, professors or anyone
            that needs a student information request as a “client” with confidentiality and the permission of
            the owner.</p>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            In today's time, making solution that can save your time and effort is highly at its vast.
            The researcher aims to contribute to that concept. In school, we do request about the student's
            credentials (like the Transcripts of Records, Copy of Grades, Certificate of Registration etc.) for
            personal use like for students who still study, for applying on scholarships, or work or to keep
            track to their grades and academic achievements as this is one of the responsibility as a college
            student, you initiate to check and keep track so that by the end of the school year, the student will
            not rattle to chase the incomplete grades.
            Included in the system is that, the admin access, and a student access, where the student
            will serve as the client and ask for request while the admin access is where the server is and will
            provide what the student had requested. The “admin access” is the one who manages the student
            credentials. The “admin access” has the privilege to use the CRUD or the create, retrieve, update,
            and delete inside the system. On the other hand, the “student access” is the one who can request
            and ask for the credentials without going on-site to receive it as the system is aiming it to be a
            “Fully Online.” Every student has a unique identification, the researcher will use that as a unique
            id in the student's information as well so you, only you can access your own personal
            information.
            This system provides you a convenient, time and effort saving to go on site, wait on long
            queue lines to get what papers you need, “Future problems, future solutions” as the researcher
            aims to achieve using this system.

        <h2>Design Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internet Connection: </strong>can be a problem in implementing this system, since the researcher
                aims to make it fully online. Nowadays, the internet is unstable because of the weather
                and other circumstances but not all the time the internet is slow. The researcher thinks
                that, the registrar can have a data base store in data storage and by the help of a system
                inside the computer you can access the data inside without the use of the internet. </li>
            <li><strong>Payment: </strong> during this method, the researcher saw that during this process the cashier
                needed to ensure the security of the client’s money, the third-party system or the online
                banking, and payment that will be collaborating with are those once that are verified, and
                trust worthy. Also, there are cases happened in the cashier when they need the signature
                attachments of the client and receiving the official receipt which cannot happen online.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking the progress: </strong> during the request the client wishes to be updated on the request
                they make, if it making progress or not. This problem shows the researcher a possible
                solution and satisfy the need of the client. Keep tracking the process of the paper you
                requested can be helpful to determine when are you going to receive the paper you
                request on the registrar and this also helps to solve the problem on long queue as this
                helps the system to achieve its goals.</li>

            To tackle common parking-related challenges, we've developed a comprehensive Parking Management System with an intuitive user interface. This system is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and highly informative, focusing on resolving issues such as limited parking spaces, traffic congestion, disputes, and inefficiency. 
            The Home Screen features a calming color palette and modern, minimalistic styling to reduce user stress and maintain a clean interface. Addressing the lack of parking information, our Real-Time Parking Availability feature includes a map with color-coded zones, indicating available (green) and occupied (red) spots. To mitigate 
            limited spaces and disputes, the Parking Reservation system allows users to reserve spots in advance. Efficiency is improved through User Profile management, enabling users to manage their profiles, view past reservations, and set preferences. The Notification Center keeps users informed with real-time notifications on reservations, 
            spot availability, and parking reminders. For resolving disputes and issues, the Help and Support section provides FAQs and a chat option with support representatives.
