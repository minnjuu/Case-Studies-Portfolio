        <h2>Project Type</h2>
        <p>
            This conceptual project includes the involvement of the students, professors or anyone
            that needs a student information request as a “client” with confidentiality and the permission of
            the owner.</p>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            In today's time, making solution that can save your time and effort is highly at its vast.
            The researcher aims to contribute to that concept. In school, we do request about the student's
            credentials (like the Transcripts of Records, Copy of Grades, Certificate of Registration etc.) for
            personal use like for students who still study, for applying on scholarships, or work or to keep
            track to their grades and academic achievements as this is one of the responsibility as a college
            student, you initiate to check and keep track so that by the end of the school year, the student will
            not rattle to chase the incomplete grades.
            Included in the system is that, the admin access, and a student access, where the student
            will serve as the client and ask for request while the admin access is where the server is and will
            provide what the student had requested. The “admin access” is the one who manages the student
            credentials. The “admin access” has the privilege to use the CRUD or the create, retrieve, update,
            and delete inside the system. On the other hand, the “student access” is the one who can request
            and ask for the credentials without going on-site to receive it as the system is aiming it to be a
            “Fully Online.” Every student has a unique identification, the researcher will use that as a unique
            id in the student's information as well so you, only you can access your own personal
            information.
            This system provides you a convenient, time and effort saving to go on site, wait on long
            queue lines to get what papers you need, “Future problems, future solutions” as the researcher
            aims to achieve using this system.

        <h2>Affinity Mapping</h2>
        <div class="image-limiter">
        <img class="center-el" src="/images/gallery4img/affmap.PNG" alt="Affinity Map">
        </div>
        <p>
            This section shows the Affinity Map that the researcher used to gather information, analyze the potential problems that the system might encounter, and develop solutions to make RegistrarGo fully online in the school. The map outlines the possible distress that students have encountered in example of "long queue lines", "slow processing", "it will take a long time before you receive what you have requested" the reason in proposing this, the researcher's analysis of the "why's" questions, and the researcher's proposed solutions on making it a "fully online" for it to be accessible for everyone without going on site to do some request. The researcher believes that these solutions would make RegistrarGo more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly for students. By implementing these solutions, the school can improve the student experience and make it easier for students to get the services they need.

        <h2>Customer Journey Map</h2>
        <div class="image-limiter">
            <img class="center-el" src="/images/gallery4img/cjm.PNG" alt="customer journey map">
        </div>
        <p>
            This section talks about how the system will take the user to the journey on how the system works and see how the work is done. Customer journey mapping is a process of visualizing the customer journey, it shows phases from awareness of the system itself to successfully received what they have requested, and during the process this helps understanding the customer's thoughts, and feelings at each step in the journey. This helps the researcher to identify and improve pain points and create a more effective and efficient and user-friendly experience.

        <h2>Design Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internet Connection: </strong>can be a problem in implementing this system, since the researcher
                aims to make it fully online. Nowadays, the internet is unstable because of the weather
                and other circumstances but not all the time the internet is slow. The researcher thinks
                that, the registrar can have a data base store in data storage and by the help of a system
                inside the computer you can access the data inside without the use of the internet. </li>
            <li><strong>Payment: </strong> during this method, the researcher saw that during this process the cashier
                needed to ensure the security of the client’s money, the third-party system or the online
                banking, and payment that will be collaborating with are those once that are verified, and
                trust worthy. Also, there are cases happened in the cashier when they need the signature
                attachments of the client and receiving the official receipt which cannot happen online.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking the progress: </strong> during the request the client wishes to be updated on the request
                they make, if it making progress or not. This problem shows the researcher a possible
                solution and satisfy the need of the client. Keep tracking the process of the paper you
                requested can be helpful to determine when are you going to receive the paper you
                request on the registrar and this also helps to solve the problem on long queue as this
                helps the system to achieve its goals.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <div class="image-limiter">
            <img class="center-el" src="images/gallery4img/user flow.PNG" alt="user flow">
        </div>
        <p>
            The user experience (UX), in the opinion of psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, focuses primarily on the mental state in which the user is completely engaged in what they are doing and the task they are attempting to accomplish. User Flow shows shapes and lines that are connecting one entity to another and this determines the journey of the user inside the system. Firstly, the user will open the system and upon opening the “home page” of the system will ask you to Log in or sign up to determine if you are a valid student, in sign up, the user must enter its personal details: name, age, student number etc. then fall into the confirmation process. On the other hand, the log in part is that the user must input the email and password, confirmation and once it is confirmed the user is good to go.  After taking the action, the system will confirm the user by “text message” as verification after the account is confirmed, the user will have the access on the system and be able to request a credential with a tracking process, check the grades and to check the balance on the accounting if you have one.  On checking the grade, the user will be able to ‘download’ the copy of it. On the cashier, the receipt for it will be generated and for the ‘document request,’ the tracking process is provided so that the user may see the process and know when it will be received. After the intention of the user is done, the user can log out and then close the system.

        <h2>Visual UI Design</h2>

            <p>
                This part of the case study shows the visual representation of the system the researcher is working on. This includes the color schemes, typography, imagery, icons, graphics etc. that keeps the aesthetic of the webpage. This shows how the webpage is presented to the user and make an experience that make them want to interact with it more. The color palette used is based on the colors of Palwan State University since the study the researcher made is inspired to that, making it minimal as it reflects the aesthetic of the researchers. The use of the icons and imagery is minimal as possible so it will not be hurtful for the eyes of the users. The researcher chose the minimal design for clear and easy navigation on every tabs included in the system as the researcher aims it to be user-friendly.
