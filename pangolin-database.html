        <h2>Project Type</h2>
        <p>
            This comprehensive database system can be utilized by the Guardians of the Palawan
            Pangolin Guild to gather and manage vital data related to these endangered animals,
            including population monitoring, rehabilitation progress, and habitat conservation. By
            facilitating research, data analysis, and collaboration with stakeholders, this project aims to
            safeguard the future of Palawan's remarkable binturongs, contributing to the broader field of
            wildlife conservation in the region.
        </p>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The Wildlife Conservation Database System for Palawan Pangolin (Balintong) project
            focuses on safeguarding the endangered Pangolin and Binturong species native to Palawan.
            This initiative delivers a tailored database system that efficiently collects, manages, and
            analyzes vital wildlife data, bolstering conservation efforts, research, and rehabilitation
            programs. Project outcomes include the development of a secure database, insightful data
            analysis, fruitful collaboration with stakeholders, the generation of key conservation insights,
            user-friendly data visualization tools, comprehensive training, and documentation. This effort
            embodies the collective commitment to preserve Palawan's extraordinary wildlife through
            evidence-based conservation strategies.

        <p>
            The affinity map presented above serves as a visual representation of the primary
            challenges and pain points encountered during the implementation of a dedicated database
            system for Palawan Pangolin conservation. The map categorizes these challenges into four
            key areas, providing a structured and comprehensive view of the obstacles faced by the
            project. Each category represents a distinct aspect of the project's complexity, ensuring that
            critical issues related to data management, communication, technology adoption, and user
            needs are systematically addressed. This affinity map aids in understanding, prioritizing, and
            strategizing solutions to enhance the success of the conservation initiative.

        <h2>Customer Journey Map</h2>
        <img class="case-img" src="/images/gallery1img/cjm.png" alt="customer journey map">
        <p>
            In this customer journey map, we follow the experience of the users as they engage
            with the 'Wildlife Conservation Database System for Palawan Pangolins (Binturong).' The
            map illustrates the various phases of user interaction with the system, from initial awareness
            of the project to becoming an active user. Design considerations are integrated into each
            phase, highlighting the importance of user-friendly design and functionality to enhance user
            experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Design Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Streamlined Data Compilation:</strong> 
                To alleviate the challenge of compiling and organizing data, the design solution
                includes an intuitive data entry interface. This interface simplifies the process of inputting new
                data and seamlessly integrates with existing information. </li>
            <li><strong>User-Friendly Transition:</strong>Addressing the transition challenge, the design focuses on user-friendliness. User 
                training and support resources will be readily available. The system's interface will be 
                intuitive, mimicking familiar manual processes as closely as possible to ease the transition.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance and Updates:</strong>To ensure the system remains current and relevant, a well-defined maintenance plan 
                is included in the design. This plan covers regular updates, security patches, and system 
                enhancements. Additionally, the system can notify users about the availability of new features 
                or data updates, ensuring it stays up to date with evolving digital concepts.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Quality Assurance:</strong>The system will incorporate data validation and quality assurance mechanisms. It will 
                require data contributors to adhere to established data collection protocols, and automated 
                checks will ensure data quality and standardization. Users will be notified of any data 
                discrepancies or errors, allowing for prompt corrections.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Data Collaboration:</strong>To facilitate collaboration and information sharing, the design emphasizes features 
                such as document sharing, and discussion forums. These functionalities will promote 
                effective collaboration among students, researchers, and conservationists, ensuring that 
                valuable insights are easily shared and discussed within the system</li>
            <li><strong>User-Centered Interface</strong>To align with user needs and preferences, a user-centered interface is of utmost 
                importance. The goal is to design an interface that places user experience as a top priority. 
                This means creating an interface that is not only intuitive and responsive but also adaptable 
                to individual preferences, ensuring users can effortlessly engage with the database. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <img class="case-img" src="images/gallery1img/User Flow.jpg" alt="user flow">
        <p>
            The user flow shows the expected tasks the user will complete when using the 
            database system. At first, the user opens the system, then they log in to verify their 
            credentials, after that they are sent to the homepage of the system where they can interact 
            with the dashboard which also allows them to navigate within the system. Users can access 
            the search functionality of the system for ease of navigation. Users can also access the 
            database where they can perform CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations as 
            well as view different data. Users can also view reports regarding the data within the 
            database. In addition, users can also use the Geographical Map to see the habitat data of 
            the recorded pangolins. Moreover, users can also customize the system by configuring the 
            user settings, where they can also change their passwords when necessary. Once users they 
            have completed their tasks, they can sign out and close the system from the homepage.

        </p>
        <h2>Visual UI Design</h2>
        <img class="case-img" src="images/gallery1img/HomePage.png" alt="visual ui design">
        <p>
            Above is the initial UI design for the homepage of the system. The selection of color palettes for this page were influenced by the logo of the Guardians of the Palawan Pangolin Guild which can be seen at the dashboard of the page. Using these colors, I was able to create a homepage having colors that blends well with each other, in addition I also used these colors to the text and icons in the page. 
	        I also went for a minimalistic approach in designing the UI of the system, keeping elements at minimal so users will not be overwhelmed and be confused about the specific functionalities of the system. More functions will soon be added to the dashboard of the system, for now I only included the important features of the system which is also the requirements of the members of the organization.
