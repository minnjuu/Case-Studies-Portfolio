        <h2>Project Type</h2>
        <p>
            This application is heavily centered on a school in Palawan which is Bataraza Central School.
            This can also be applied to other elementary schools. The project's effectiveness is relative to the
            education level of the students, from Kindergarten to Grade 2.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
            An Innovative Educational Technology Application - Fast Tracking Your Education. This
            project was in response to some of the challenges that faces students and teachers in the contemporary
            classroom. The idea behind this technology-enhanced learning device aimed at equipping students
            with a tool that enhances personalized learning and provides instructors with effective teaching
            materials. Finally, “FastTrack Learning” strived to raise student performance by finding ways to
            excellence beyond traditional methods and leveraging modern technologies.

        <h2>Affinity Mapping</h2>
        <div class="image-limiter">
            <img class="case-image" src="/images/gallery2img/affmap.png" alt="Affinity Map">
        </div>
        <p>
            The proposed features for the educational app are categorized into three groups based on shared themes. Group 1 focuses on enhancing communication with features like in-app chat messaging, discussion forums, and video conferencing, fostering a dynamic and collaborative learning environment. Group 2 emphasizes improvements to search functionality, including advanced search filters, enhanced keyword search, and search suggestions to streamline content discovery. Group 3 addresses offline accessibility with features like downloadable content, an offline mode for viewing pre-downloaded material, and synchronization to ensure consistent user progress across online and offline modes. These design solutions aim to provide a more targeted and systematic approach to addressing user needs and challenges identified during the UX design process.
        </p>

        <h2>Customer Journey Map</h2>
        <div class="image-limiter">
            <img class="center-el" src="/images/gallery2img/cjm.png" alt="customer journey map">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            In this journey map, we can see that we have a scenario where a student would like to get the attention of his teacher for assistance, a student can hesitate on his action due to things that can cause shyness to the student, he will then resort to asking his classmates for help because of this. As a result of that, in the journey mapping, we have created a solution for the problem that is being faced by the student which is making a button for the student to call the teacher without asking or distracting the other students. We also should keep in mind that there will be different scenarios that need different solutions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Design Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Search Capabilities:</strong> Users will be able to quickly locate particular study materials and resources, which will save time and
                reduce frustration. The effectiveness of the educational process will increase as a result. The design solution would be to add more sophisticated filters, auto-suggestions, and an understandable
                methodology to the app's search capability.</li>
            <li><strong>Access to Study Materials While Offline:</strong> Create an offline mode that enables users to download and access study materials without an internet
                connection as the design solution. With this, students will be able to access educational resources continuously, even in locations
                with poor or no internet connectivity. </li>
            <li><strong>Improvement of Communication Channels:</strong> Implement a more powerful messaging and notification mechanism within the app to improve
                communication between teachers and students. The desired outcome is improved teacher-student engagement, prompt responses to
                questions, and the creation of a more collaborative learning environment through improved
                communication channels.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <div class="image-limiter">
            <img class="center-el" src="images/gallery2img/User Flow.png" alt="user flow">
        </div>
        <p>
            In this User flow diagram, we can visualize how the application will flow when users are using the application. At the start, the application will ask 
            the user if they want to log in as a student or a teacher, then, after selection, the user will then input his account name and his password for confirmation. 
            The application will show two different menus, either you're a teacher or a student. Then the application will then display the appropriate menus for both, the 
            student for the student menu, where they can select activities, their scores, to call a teacher, and other options. in the teacher's menu, they will then see the 
            options for teachers, these are schedules, managing students, and notifications.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Visual UI Design</h2>
        <div class="image-limiter">
            <img class="center-el" src="/images/gallery2img/pt1.jpg" alt="visual ui design">
        </div>
        <p>
            The color of the menus for the teacher that I am using is a combination of the colors of the school itself, in this case, I will be going for blue, white, black, a bit of yellow and red. The menu for the teacher will also have the logo as its background picture for more formal presentation for the teachers. Teachers will be more appreciative of simple design for their UI, if we are putting vibrant colors in the teachers UI, this will result to eye strains as they are going to be looking at the screens of the devices in use more longer than the student
            In the student's menu, I will be going for more vibrant colors for the children's eye. This will improve the focus as well as keeping the eyes of the students entertained when looking at the UI. I will be going for the colors and different shades of green, blue, yellow, red, pink, brown and white, there will also be pictures and figures for the designs of the UI, students will appreciate the creative looks of the UI and will result in a more captivating menu.
            Painponts stated on the previous pages regarding the lack of communication between the teachers and the students will now be fixed, students will now have the option to call for the teacher's attention via a button. Students will have the ability to press this button and call for a teacher when they need help on their activities, when they lack understanding on the instructions that is stated in the activity, this will also help the students call for the teacher when they need assistance in their activities, like questions, a bit of tutorial, or a bit of advice.
            Offline modules should be available now. Students reported that they should have the ability to download their modules for offline use, this will give the students the ability to read their lessons in advance, this can also give the parents the ability to teach their students while they are at home.
