        <h2>Project Type</h2>
        <p>
            Solving the parking predicament at Palawan State University would typically be considered an infrastructure or urban planning project. 
            This type of project would involve designing and implementing solutions to alleviate parking issues on the university campus, which may 
            include constructing new parking facilities, improving traffic flow, or implementing policies and technology to manage parking more efficiently.
        </p>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This case study outlines the design and implementation of a parking management solution at Palawan State University (PSU). PSU faced a 
            persistent parking predicament, with limited spaces and chaotic parking patterns causing frustration among students, faculty, and visitors. 
            The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly and efficient parking system that would alleviate congestion and enhance campus mobility.

            To tackle common parking-related challenges, we've developed a comprehensive Parking Management System with an intuitive user interface. This system is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and highly informative, focusing on resolving issues such as limited parking spaces, traffic congestion, disputes, and inefficiency. 
            The Home Screen features a calming color palette and modern, minimalistic styling to reduce user stress and maintain a clean interface. Addressing the lack of parking information, our Real-Time Parking Availability feature includes a map with color-coded zones, indicating available (green) and occupied (red) spots. To mitigate 
            limited spaces and disputes, the Parking Reservation system allows users to reserve spots in advance. Efficiency is improved through User Profile management, enabling users to manage their profiles, view past reservations, and set preferences. The Notification Center keeps users informed with real-time notifications on reservations, 
            spot availability, and parking reminders. For resolving disputes and issues, the Help and Support section provides FAQs and a chat option with support representatives.
