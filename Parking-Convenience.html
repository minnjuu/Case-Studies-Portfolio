        <h2>Project Type</h2>
        <p>
            This application is heavily centered on a school in Palawan which is Bataraza Central School.
            This can also be applied to other elementary schools. The project's effectiveness is relative to the
            education level of the students, from Kindergarten to Grade 2.
        </p>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This case study outlines the design and implementation of a parking management solution at Palawan State University (PSU). PSU faced a persistent parking predicament, with limited spaces and chaotic parking patterns causing frustration among students, faculty, and visitors. The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly and efficient parking system that would alleviate congestion and enhance campus mobility.

            To tackle common parking-related challenges, we've developed a comprehensive Parking Management System with an intuitive user interface. This system is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and highly informative, focusing on resolving issues such as limited parking spaces, traffic congestion, disputes, and inefficiency. 
            The Home Screen features a calming color palette and modern, minimalistic styling to reduce user stress and maintain a clean interface. Addressing the lack of parking information, our Real-Time Parking Availability feature includes a map with color-coded zones, indicating available (green) and occupied (red) spots. To mitigate 
            limited spaces and disputes, the Parking Reservation system allows users to reserve spots in advance. Efficiency is improved through User Profile management, enabling users to manage their profiles, view past reservations, and set preferences. The Notification Center keeps users informed with real-time notifications on reservations, 
            spot availability, and parking reminders. For resolving disputes and issues, the Help and Support section provides FAQs and a chat option with support representatives.
